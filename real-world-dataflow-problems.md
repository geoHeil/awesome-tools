# real world dataflow problems
Some problems I observed in real dataflow pipelines

## ETL
- quality controlling data prior to ingest from source systems
- actually knowing (responsibility for bought applications) where to find the data(base) and who knows about the format 

## machine learning
- no proper strategy for holdout group and prevention of feedback
- model serving not scalable, no fully fledged ML solution available


## hiring
- if in doubt hire a data engineer and not a data scientist (especially when starting out to bring data driven processes into the company) assuming the engineer also has a feeling for strategy
- make sure to have enough *process* and engineering in the team to build a solid and *regular* IT software development lifecycle process accoring to current standards
