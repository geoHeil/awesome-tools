## hardware setup


I realized that my photo camera can also record videos. Since then, I always use it for this purpose.

- I have a Nikon D850, but any other decent photo camera works just as well as a webcam.
- The camera is mounted on a tripod.
- It is connected to a power outlet because otherwise, the battery would need to be replaced every few hours during video recordings.

### HDMI Capturing

- Theoretically, you could simply connect the camera to the computer via USB – in my case, with the Nikon Webcam Utility. However, it was limited back then (it only worked in Zoom but not in Teams or WebEx).
- This was frustrating for me.
- Instead, I got a mini HDMI 4-channel mixer, the [Atem Mini](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/at/products/atemmini). It has additional advantages, for example, I can also mix the iPad or screen content with the green screen, and always be seen in the foreground in front of the PPT or coding window.
- The green screen is from [Elgato](https://www.elgato.com/de/green-screen) (you didn't see it in use yesterday).

### Audio

- Good audio is important – and as long as you don't want to combine it with good video simultaneously, it's super easy. I use a [Blue Yeti microphone](https://www.bluemic.com/de-de/products/yeti/), which can be easily connected via USB – done. And it's dramatically better.
- Unfortunately, I have problems with the audio input on the ATEM Mini and therefore route audio and video separately (resulting in a few frames delay). Did you notice this yesterday?
- Nowadays I sue the yeti for most teams/zoom calls and it works great. But for recordings and live streams I use https://rode.com/de/microphones/wireless/wirelesspro directly connected timecoded to my camera for the best streaming/recording/audio experience

### Lighting

- Instead of investing in an extremely expensive camera, good audio and lighting are better investments.
- I use:
  - 2x Key Lights from [Elgato](https://www.elgato.com/de/key-light) – they are great and you can adjust the brightness and color temperature.
  - A smart lamp from [Luke Roberts](https://www.luke-roberts.com/products/smart-lamp-model-f-white?ls=de) with a slight blue/purple tint for the background, or additional white lighting when using the green screen.

### Control

- With the [Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/de/stream-deck-mk2) you can flexibly control the lights, the HDMI mixer (ATEM), or any other actions with a hardware button and even record and play macros.
- One or two USB hubs.
- Lots of cables (HDMI, USB, etc.).
- For controlling the Atem Mini: a small network switch and cables (only works via TCP-IP).

### On-Screen

- The [Logitech Spotlight Presentation Remote](https://www.logitech.com/de-at/products/presenters/spotlight-presentation-remote.910-004862.html?crid=11) is a great laser pointer that also works remotely in Webex or for 1000 people with 3 projectors simultaneously – because it's digital. The magnifier and focus gimmicks are great!
- [DemoPro](http://www.demoproapp.com/) (Mac) offers similar features for Windows for countdown timers and drawing directly on the screen and is a good addition.

I hope you find some useful tips here.
