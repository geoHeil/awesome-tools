## hardware setup

I realized that my photo camera can also record videos. Since then, I always use it for this purpose.

I have a Nikon D850, but any other decent photo camera works just as well as a webcam.
The camera is mounted on a tripod.
It is connected to a power outlet because otherwise, the battery would need to be replaced every few hours during video recordings.

### HDMI Capturing

Theoretically, you could simply connect the camera to the computer via USB – in my case, with the Nikon Webcam Utility. However, it was limited back then (it only worked in Zoom but not in Teams or WebEx).
This was frustrating for me.
Instead, I got a mini HDMI 4-channel mixer, the Atem Mini. It has additional advantages, for example, I can also mix the iPad or screen content with the green screen, and always be seen in the foreground in front of the PPT or coding window.
The green screen is from Elgato (you didn't see it in use yesterday).

### Audio

Good audio is important – and as long as you don't want to combine it with good video simultaneously, it's super easy. I use a Blue Yeti microphone, which can be easily connected via USB – done. And it's dramatically better.
Unfortunately, I have problems with the audio input on the ATEM Mini and therefore route audio and video separately (resulting in a few frames delay). Did you notice this yesterday?

### Lighting

Instead of investing in an extremely expensive camera, good audio and lighting are better investments.
I use:
    2x Key Lights from Elgato – they are great and you can adjust the brightness and color temperature.
    A smart lamp from Luke Roberts with a slight blue/purple tint for the background, or additional white lighting when using the green screen.

### Control

With the Stream Deck you can flexibly control the lights, the HDMI mixer (ATEM), or any other actions with a hardware button and even record and play macros.
One or two USB hubs.
Lots of cables (HDMI, USB, etc.).
For controlling the Atem Mini: a small network switch and cables (only works via TCP-IP).

### On-Screen

The Logitech Spotlight Presentation Remote is a great laser pointer that also works remotely in Webex or for 1000 people with 3 projectors simultaneously – because it's digital. The magnifier and focus gimmicks are great!
DemoPro (Mac) offers similar features for Windows for countdown timers and drawing directly on the screen and is a good addition.
